When can we not use react, and should we mix different react applications for MPAs?

React, SPA & MPA — Quick Notes

What React is good at
• App-like UIs
• Complex client state
• Frequent interactions
• Long user sessions
• No full page reloads
Examples: dashboards, editors, chat apps

When NOT to use React
• Mostly static content
• Simple forms + links
• SEO is top priority
• Fast first load matters most
• Little client-side state
Examples: blogs, landing pages, docs

SPA (Single Page App)
• One JS app controls navigation
• Fast in-app navigation
• Heavy JS upfront
• Harder SEO
• App-like UX
Use when UI state is complex.


MPA (Multi Page App)
• Each page is independent
• Server handles navigation
• Better SEO by default
• Faster initial load
• Simpler mental model
Use for content-driven sites.


Mixing SPA and MPA (Common)
• Marketing site → MPA
• Dashboard / app → React SPA
• Same domain, different architecture
Very common in real products.


Multiple React apps?
Yes.
• Different sections → different React apps
• Better isolation
• Easier scaling for teams

Example:
/dashboard → React app
/admin     → React app

One big React app?
• Shared routing & state
• Good for single-purpose apps
• Harder to scale long-term

Modern approach
• Hybrid frameworks (Next, Remix, Astro)
• Server-render pages
• React only where needed
Best of both worlds.


Rule to remember
If it feels like an app → React
If it feels like a website → MPA


The modern compromise (important)
Hybrid approaches:
Next.js / Remix / Astro
Server components
Partial hydration
Islands architecture

They give:
MPA benefits
SPA interactivity where needed



Can one React app be “tweaked” to behave like MPA?
Yes, but it’s often worse than true MPA.
Problems:
Still loads JS for everything
SEO hacks
Bigger bundle
Slower first load



The real tradeoff between SPA and MPA
SPA:
Heavy JS upfront
Complex state
Harder SEO
App-like UX

MPA:
Fast initial load
Simple state
SEO-friendly
Page-based UX

They solve different problems. As everthing when it comes to architechture. Neither is better or worse in this case.
