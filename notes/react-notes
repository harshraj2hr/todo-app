useEffect exists because React re-renders unpredictably
and side effects must not run during render.

If React rendered only once, you wouldn’t need it.

remember this, Ask:
“Am I synchronizing with something outside React?”
Yes → useEffect
No → state + render

Why React doesn’t auto-handle this
Because:
side effects must be controlled
cleanup matters
effects may restart
render must stay pure


Key rule (important)
If your code touches something React does not own, use useEffect.
Examples:
fetch
setTimeout
addEventListener
document.title
localStorage
WebSocket
analytics


❌ Render-based
if (start) {
  setInterval(...)
}
Leads to:
multiple intervals
memory leaks

✅ Effect-based
useEffect(() => {
  if (!start) return;
  const id = setInterval(...)
  return () => clearInterval(id);
}, [start]);

React has two worlds

1. React world
state
props
rendering JSX

2. Outside world
APIs
timers
subscriptions
DOM mutations
browser APIs
localStorage
websockets

useEffect is the bridge between them.
